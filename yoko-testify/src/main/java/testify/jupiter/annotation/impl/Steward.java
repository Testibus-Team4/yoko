/**
 * This class provides the mechanism to create, store, and retrieve
 * an instance of an object for managing some orthogonal aspect of a
 * test or test case.
 *
 * Since this is to be used with an annotation, the annotated member
 * will not provide a location for the annotation to store its artifacts.
 * Instead, the Jupiter extension context store for a type-specific namespace
 * is retrieved, and the test class is used as the key.
 *
 * So, for a given extension context, artifact type, and annotated test class,
 * there will exist at most one such artifact. This artifact will be retrieved
 * and used by the implementing child class to allow state to be propagated from
 * one method invocation to another during the handling of the specified annotation
 * <p>
 * <em>Use of this as a base class renders child logic difficult to follow.
 * This base class is deprecated in favour of the {@link Summoner} interface,
 * which supports both single and repeatable annotations.</em>
